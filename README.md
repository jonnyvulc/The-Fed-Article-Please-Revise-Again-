ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Labor
(Department) is publishing this final rule to adjust for inflation the civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (Inflation Adjustment Act). The Inflation Adjustment Act requires the Department to annually adjust its civil money penalty levels for inflation no later than January 15 of each year. The Inflation Adjustment Act provides that agencies shall adjust civil monetary penalties notwithstanding Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Additionally, the Inflation Adjustment Act provides a cost-of-living formula for adjustment of the civil penalties. Accordingly, this final rule sets forth the Department’s 2024 annual adjustments for inflation to its civil monetary penalties.
DATES: This final rule is effective on January 15, 2024. As provided by the Inflation Adjustment Act, the increased penalty levels apply to any penalties assessed after January 15, 2024.

I. Background
On November 2, 2015, Congress enacted the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, Public Law 114–74, sec. 701 (Inflation Adjustment Act), which further amended the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 as previously amended by the 1996 Debt Collection Improvement Act (collectively, the ‘‘Prior Inflation Adjustment Act’’), to improve the effectiveness of civil monetary penalties and to maintain their deterrent effect. The Inflation Adjustment Act required agencies to (1) adjust the level of civil monetary penalties with an initial ‘‘catch-up’’ adjustment through an interim final rule (IFR); and (2) make subsequent annual adjustments for inflation no later than January 15 of each year.
On July 1, 2016, the Department published an IFR that established the initial catch-up adjustment for most civil penalties that the Department administers and requested comments. See 81 FR 43430 (DOL IFR). On January 18, 2017, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2017 Annual Adjustment for those civil monetary penalties adjusted in the DOL IFR. See 82 FR 5373 (DOL 2017 Annual

  Adjustment). On July 1, 2016, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) (collectively, ‘‘the Departments’’) jointly published an IFR that established the initial catch-up adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced in connection with the employment of temporary nonimmigrant workers under the H–2B program. See 81 FR 42983 (Joint IFR). On March 17, 2017, the Departments jointly published the final rule establishing the 2017 Annual Adjustment for the H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 82 FR 14147 (Joint 2017 Annual Adjustment). The Joint 2017 Annual Adjustment also explained that DOL would make future adjustments to the H–2B civil monetary penalties consistent with DOL’s delegated authority under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(14), Immigration and Nationality Act section 214(c)(14), and the Inflation Adjustment Act. See 82 FR 14147–48. On January 2, 2018, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2018 Annual Adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, including H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 83 FR 7 (DOL 2018 Annual Adjustment). On January 23, 2019, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2019 Annual Adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, including H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 84 FR 213 (DOL 2019 Annual Adjustment). On January 15, 2020, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2020 Annual Adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, including H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 85 FR 2292 (DOL 2020 Annual Adjustment). On January 14, 2021, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2021 Annual Adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department,
including H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 86 FR 2964 (DOL 2021 Annual Adjustment). On January 14, 2022, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2022 Annual Adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, including H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 87 FR 2328 (DOL 2022 Annual Adjustment). The DOL 2022 Annual Adjustment also included the first annual adjustments for a newly enacted civil monetary penalty regarding retention of tips under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and a newly established civil monetary penalty regarding whistleblower protections under the high-wage components of the labor value content requirements of the United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (USMCA). On January 13, 2023, the Department published the final rule establishing the 2023 Annual Adjustment for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, including H–2B civil monetary penalties. See 88 FR 2210 (DOL 2023 Annual Adjustment).
This rule implements the 2024 annual inflation adjustments, as required by the Inflation Adjustment Act, for civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by the Department, including H–2B civil monetary penalties. The Inflation Adjustment Act provides that the increased penalty levels apply to any penalties assessed after the effective date of the increase. Pursuant to the Inflation Adjustment Act, this final rule is published notwithstanding Section 553 of the APA.
This rule is not significant under Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule as not a ‘major rule,’ as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
II. Adjustment for 2024
The Department has undertaken a thorough review of civil penalties administered by its various components pursuant to the Inflation Adjustment Act and in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget.1
The Department first identified the most recent penalty amount, which is the amount established by the 2023 annual adjustment as set forth in the DOL 2023 Annual Adjustment published on January 13, 2023.
The Department is required to calculate the annual adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI–U). Annual inflation adjustments are based on the percent change between the October CPI–U preceding the date of the adjustment, and the prior year’s October CPI–U; in this case, the percent change between the October 2023 CPI–U and the October 2022 CPI–U. The cost-of- living adjustment multiplier for 2024, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI–U) for the month of October 2023, not seasonally adjusted, is 1.03241.2 In order to compute the 2024 annual adjustment, the Department multiplied the most recent penalty amount for each applicable penalty by the multiplier, 1.03241, and rounded to the nearest dollar.
As provided by the Inflation Adjustment Act, the increased penalty levels apply to any penalties assessed after the effective date of this rule.3 Accordingly, for penalties assessed after January 15, 2024, whose associated violations occurred after the applicable dates listed below, the higher penalty amounts outlined in this rule will apply. The tables below demonstrate the penalty amounts that apply:

III. Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1995 the
(44 U.S.C. 3507(d)) requires that
of Department consider the impact paperwork and other information
collection burdens imposed on the public. The Department has determined that this final rule does not require any collection of information.
IV. Administrative Procedure Act
The Inflation Adjustment Act provides that agencies shall annually adjust civil monetary penalties for inflation notwithstanding section 553 of the APA. Additionally, the Inflation Adjustment Act provides a nondiscretionary cost-of-living formula for annual adjustment of the civil monetary penalties. For these reasons, the requirements in sections 553(b), (c), and (d) of the APA, relating to notice and comment and requiring that a rule be effective 30 days after publication in
the Federal Register, are inapplicable.
V. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive Order 13563: Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review
Executive Order 12866 (as supplemented by E.O. 14094) requires that regulatory agencies assess both the costs and benefits of significant regulatory actions. Under the Executive Order, a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ is one meeting any of a number of specified conditions, including the following: having an annual effect on the economy of $200 million or more; creating a serious inconsistency or interfering with an action of another agency; materially altering the budgetary impact of entitlements or the rights of entitlement recipients; or raising novel legal or policy issues.
The Department has determined that this final rule is not a ‘‘significant’’ regulatory action and a cost-benefit and economic analysis is not required. This regulation merely adjusts civil monetary penalties in accordance with inflation as required by the Inflation Adjustment Act, and has no impact on disclosure or
compliance costs. The benefit provided by the inflationary adjustment to the maximum civil monetary penalties is that of maintaining the incentive for the regulated community to comply with the laws enforced by the Department, and not allowing the incentive to be diminished by inflation.
Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility to minimize burden.
The Inflation Adjustment Act directed the Department to issue the annual adjustments without regard to section 553 of the APA. In that context, Congress has already determined that any possible increase in costs is justified

  ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES1
by the overall benefits of such adjustments. This final rule makes only the statutory changes outlined herein; thus there are no alternatives or further analysis required by Executive Order 13563.
VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act and Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (RFA), imposes certain requirements on Federal agency rules that are subject to the notice and comment requirements of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(b). This final rule is exempt from the requirements of the APA because the Inflation Adjustment Act directed the Department to issue the annual adjustments without regard to section 553 of the APA. Therefore, the requirements of the RFA applicable to notices of proposed rulemaking, 5 U.S.C. 603, do not apply to this rule. Accordingly, the Department is not required to either certify that the final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis.
VII. Other Regulatory Considerations
A. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. This Final Rule will not result in such an expenditure. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.
B. Executive Order 13132: Federalism
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 667) requires Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-approved State Plans to have standards and an enforcement program that are at least as effective as Federal OSHA’s standards and enforcement program. OSHA-approved State Plans must have maximum and minimum penalty levels that are at least as effective as Federal OSHA’s, per section 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act. See also 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(xi); 1902.37(b)(12). State
Plans are required to increase their penalties in alignment with OSHA’s
penalty increases to maintain at least as effective penalty levels.
State Plans are not required to impose monetary penalties on state and local government employers. See
§ 1956.11(c)(2)(x). Six (6) states and one territory have State Plans that cover only state and local government employees: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and the Virgin Islands. Therefore, the requirements to increase the penalty levels do not apply to these State Plans. Twenty-one states and one U.S. territory have State Plans that cover both private sector employees and state and local government employees: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. They must increase their penalties for private-sector employers.
Other than as listed above, this final rule does not have federalism implications because it does not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Accordingly, Executive Order 13132, Federalism, requires no further agency action or analysis.
C. Executive Order 13175: Indian Tribal Governments
This final rule does not have ‘‘tribal implications’’ because it does not have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Accordingly, Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, requires no further agency action or analysis.

Per- and Poly-Fluoroalkyl Chemical Substances Designated as Inactive on the TSCA Inventory; Significant New Use Rule
AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA is finalizing a significant new use rule (SNUR) for 329 per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are designated as inactive on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory. PFAS are a group of chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s because of their useful properties, such as water and stain resistance. Many PFAS break down very slowly and can build up in people, animals, and the environment over time.
Exposure at certain levels to specific PFAS can adversely impact human
health and other living things. Persons subject to the final SNUR are required
to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacture (including import) or processing of the chemical substance for a significant new use. Once EPA receives a notification, EPA must review and make an affirmative determination on the notification, and take such action as is required by any such determination before the manufacture (including import) or processing for the significant new use can commence. Such a review will assess whether the new use may present unreasonable risk to health or the environment and ensure that EPA takes appropriate action as required to protect health or the environment.
DATES: This final rule is effective March 11, 2024. For purposes of judicial review, this rule shall be promulgated at 1 p.m. (EST) on January 25, 2024.
